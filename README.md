# NIOS - Scriptable
## A node package that forces types on iOS Scriptable's JS files for better coding.
You may use `.ts` files and compile them using TypeScript for easy conversions and usage from typescript to javascript. 

Please note that when using this method of development, it is essential to remove the imports from this library for correct
execution in the Scriptable app itself.
