 * Presents a date picker.
 *
 * Use the date picker to select a date. After configuring the date picker, call `pickTime()`, `pickDate()`,
 * `pickDateAndTime()` or `pickCountDownTimer()` which will present the date picker modally.
 *
 * The `pickTime()`, `pickDate()` and `pickDateAndTime()` methods returns a promise that carries the selected
 * date and the `pickCountDownTimer()` method returns a promise that carries the selected duration.
 *
 * The date picker can be configured towards picking a date with or without time, just a time or picking hours and minutes for a timer.
